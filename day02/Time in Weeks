# use of f-Strings

age = input()

#create a program using f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90
#it will take your age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format: 
# You have X weeks left

######Your code below###########

#calculate time left in years
age_left = 90 - int(age)

#convert age_left to months
age_in_months = age_left * 12 

#convert age_months in weeks
age_in_weeks = age_in_months * 4 

print(f"You have {age_in_weeks} left")
